# Co-channel Awareness and Mitigation Workshop

Presented at GNU Radio Conference 2019.  

Companion materials for the workshop

## Abstract

A common problem in realistic communication scenarios is dealing with other transmission sources on the same frequency at the same time. We present a survey of situational awareness and interference mitigation techniques interactively demonstrated using GNU Radio with a focus on multi-antenna signal processing. Various MIMO and Beamforming techniques will be explored and example code will be provided for participants to try in real time.
